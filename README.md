<!-- Introduction -->
<h3>library-management-app</h3>

Simple application for managing a library database.

<!-- ABOUT -->
### About

This project is a continuation of a database project I did for my university course. My goal was to learn how to use Spring Data JPA and Hibernate. It is not finished yet, as I am in the process of implementing the REST API. 

So far, the database is fully mapped and I have created multiple queries. All the queries are tested using JUnit5. I have used Spring profiles to separate the test and development environments. 

### The database
The original database was designed using Oracle Data Modeler and was supposed to manage multiple libraries, that have a shared account and loan system, but separate book inventories. Below you can find the database schema. The database project is quite simple and might not be the best example of a database design, but nonetheless it was a good learning experience.

<!-- DB SCHEMA -->
#### Database Schema
Can be found in the repo [here](https://github.com/kapiaszczyk/library-JPA-project/blob/main/readme_files/Relational_1.png). 

#### Example SQL queries
Example queries to test the database can be found [here](https://github.com/kapiaszczyk/library-management-app/blob/main/readme_files/example_queries.sql).

#### Sample data - `data.sql`
Sample data that is used to populate the database for tests can be found [here](https://github.com/kapiaszczyk/library-management-app/blob/main/src/main/resources/data.sql).

### Some more interesting queries
* `findByCreditsBookTitle(String title)` - returns authors credited for books with a given title
* `findByCreditsAuthorLastName(String lastName)` - returns books with authors with a given last name
* `findByAccountNumberAndLoanStatus(Long accountNumber, String loanStatus)` - returns books loaned by a given account with a given loan status
* and more CRUD operations such as find books by title, category, author, etc.

### Running the application
To run the application, you need to have Java and Maven installed. You can run the application using the command `mvn spring-boot:run`. The application will run on port 8080. You can access the H2 console at `localhost:8080/h2-console`. The database is populated with data using the `data.sql` file. The database is created in memory and is destroyed when the application is stopped.

For the application to run properly, set the active profile to `prod` in the `application.properties` file. The `test` profile is used for testing purposes.

<!-- To-do -->
### To-do
- [ ] Implement the REST API and test it using Postman
- [ ] Write test cases in postman
- [ ] Consider implementing DTOs
- [x] Optimize associations between entities
- [ ] Fully document the project

### REST API 
I am in the process of implementing the endpoints. Some example endpoints that I will implement include:
- [x] GET list of books with fields title, isbn and authors
- [ ] GET list of books with a given title and in given library
- [ ] GET list of books written by given author
- [ ] GET list of books that are loaned
- [ ] GET list of books that are not loaned

I also want to add "internal" endpoints, that will serve GET, POST and DELETE requests to do with adding books, accounts etc. that will require some sort of authentication to access.

<!-- Introduction -->
<h3 >library-JPA-project</h3>

Simple application for managing a library database.

<!-- ABOUT -->
### About

This project is a continuation of a database project I did for my university course. My goal was to learn how to use Spring Data JPA and Hibernate. It is not finished yet, as I am in the process of implementing the REST API. 

So far, the database is fully mapped and I have created multiple queries. All the queries are tested using JUnit5.

### The database
The original database was designed using Oracle Data Modeler and was supposed to manage multiple libraries, that have a shared account and loan system, but separate book inventories. Below you can find the database schema. The database project is quite simple and might not be the best example of a database design, but nonetheless it was a good learning experience.

<!-- DB SCHEMA -->
#### Database Schema
Can be found in the repo [here](https://github.com/kapiaszczyk/library-JPA-project/blob/main/readme_files/Relational_1.png).


#### Some more interesting queries
* `findByCreditsBookTitle(String title)` - returns authors credited for books with a given title
* `findByCreditsAuthorLastName(String lastName)` - returns books with authors with a given last name
* `findByAccountNumberAndLoanStatus(Long accountNumber, String loanStatus)` - returns books loaned by a given account with a given loan status
* and more CRUD operations such as find books by title, category, author, etc.
